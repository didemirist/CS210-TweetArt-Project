# CS210 - Course Project - Didem Iris Topbas
# Tweet-Art

# Introduction:
This project aims to explore the sentiment of my tweets (which I post very frequently and with random emotions) throughout the seasons and analyze the seasons by exploring when I posted negative tweets the most or positive tweets the most, which would create a sense of overall average sentiment for my tweets.

# Hypothesis: 
The sentiment of my tweets is influenced by various factors such as personal achievements, various life events, and personal interactions. My hypothesis is that the beginning of holidays during the summer season is likely to lead to more positive and upbeat expressions in my tweets, so I expect that the highest sentiment month will be in the summer seasons compared to other seasons. 

# Motivation:
For this project, I was very curious for the result of this analysis and whether my hypothesis would be proved correct or not. I also wanted to delve into diverse set of techniques throughout the project such as using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and creative visualization of my twitter data.

# Tools used:
Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.11.7.
